# Weather UNO Q Coding Challenge 

The new Arduino UNO Q offers exciting modes to use really advanced technology in an easy way in your daily life. Thanks to its dual-brain you have in your hands a computer and a microcontroller all together that can communicate between them ad being programmed together thanks to Arduino Applab.

Are you ready to solve this coding challente? Let's go!


## Once upon a time...

Arduino born more than 20 years ago in a litle village... in Italy!

Ivrea is famous for three things. The first one is its famous Carnival, where the whole city is at war fighting agains each others throwing orange fruits... I know! Crazy right?

The second one is that Ivrea was the city where the company "Olivetti" was found. Olivetti manufactured typewritters that were used everywhere around the world, creating at some point one of the first personal computers ever created...

The third one is that, at the old headquarters of Olivetti: "La casa Blu" the Open Source Arduino Movement starts its journey...

## The Challenge

This example use the MPU or Microcomputer to get the Weather information of a given city from the internet **when the microcontroller ask for it** and returns it so the microcontroller can show a nice animation on the LED Matrix Screen of the board depending of the actual weather on a given city...

However, the code is not complete... **Are you capable of complete the code to show on the LED Matrix the actual Weather of the city where Arduino was born?**
