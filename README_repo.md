# weather-unoq-coding-challenge
A small coding challenge intended to be used for educational purposes to promote the use of Arduino UNO Q and Arduino Applab.

The challenge is a small modification of the Weather Example provided by default by Arduino Applab, with some lines of code removed and a new readme that briefly presents the history of Arduino and proposes the challenge.

## Difficulty Level

- Easy: Challenge is attention span. If the user reads the text 80% of the challenge is solved, remaining 20% is a matter of reading an error log and add some lines of code.
